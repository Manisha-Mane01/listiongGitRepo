<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">Traditional food ordering systems often lack efficient user support, leading to user dissatisfaction and increased support workload. Manually managing FAQs can be time-consuming, and users may struggle to find relevant information. The need arises for an automated solution that streamlines food order operations and enhances user support.</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">The Food Order Management System is designed to simplify food ordering processes. Users can add products to their cart, manage orders, and complete checkouts seamlessly. The integration of a Chatbot powered by Azure AI Services enriches the user experience by providing quick access to a comprehensive FAQs section. Users can ask questions related to the food ordering process, and the Chatbot intelligently responds with relevant information.</p><br>
